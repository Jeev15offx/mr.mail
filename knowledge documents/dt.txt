1?? EMPATHIZE - Understanding the User’s Problem
?? Who are the users?

Job seekers who receive emails about job opportunities.
People who are unaware of fake job scams.
?? User’s pain points:

Difficulty identifying real vs. fake job emails.
Scammers use professional language to look real.
Losing money and personal data to fraudulent job offers.
Missing out on real job opportunities due to fear of scams.
2?? DEFINE - Clearly Stating the Problem
?? Problem Statement:

"Job seekers struggle to identify fake job offers in their inbox. Fraudulent emails appear professional and trick users into giving personal details or money. There is no automated way to detect, categorize, and warn users about potential scams."

3?? IDEATE - Brainstorming Possible Solutions
?? Potential Features for the App:
? Copy-Paste Email Detection: Users paste the email content, and the app analyzes it for fraud patterns.
? Automated Storage: The email gets saved to a database for future reference.
? Risk Categorization: Emails are classified as "Safe," "Suspicious," or "High Risk."
? Snooze Alert: If a user is unsure, they can snooze the email for review later.
? Machine Learning & AI: Train the system to detect fraud patterns using real scam data.

4?? PROTOTYPE - Building the MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
We need to develop an app with three main parts:

??? Frontend (User Interface) - Flutter or React Native

Users can paste job emails into a text box.
The app shows risk level (safe, suspicious, high risk).
Users get alerts & snooze options.
??? Backend (Processing & Analysis) - Python (FastAPI)

Stores emails in a database (PostgreSQL, Firebase, or MongoDB).
Checks for fraud indicators using AI & rule-based detection.
Provides risk analysis based on keywords, links, sender details.
?? Integration with Email Services (Future Scope)

If Google allows, the app can directly scan the Gmail inbox using the Gmail API.
Users don’t need to copy-paste, the app scans inbox automatically.
5?? TEST - Validating the Solution
?? Testing strategies:
? Collect real fake job emails and check if the app accurately classifies them.
? Get feedback from job seekers to improve accuracy & UI/UX.
? Compare with existing spam filters to ensure better results.

?? Final Solution (Using Design Thinking)
Understanding Users: Job seekers facing scam emails.
Defining the Issue: Fake job emails are hard to detect.
Generating Ideas: Automated email risk analysis.
Prototyping: Mobile app (Frontend: Flutter/React Native, Backend: FastAPI).
Testing: Checking accuracy with real scam emails.
